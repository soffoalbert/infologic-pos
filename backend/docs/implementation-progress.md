# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of backend implementation according to the implementation plan.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

### Completed Items

- ✅ PostgreSQL configuration in `application.properties` with tenant-specific schema isolation
- ✅ Multi-tenant configuration with TenantContext for setting and retrieving tenant IDs
- ✅ Event-driven architecture components:
  - ✅ Kafka configuration with proper producers and consumers
  - ✅ Base Event class and specialized event types (SaleEvent, InventoryEvent, PaymentEvent, SyncEvent)
  - ✅ EventPublisherService for sending events to Kafka topics
  - ✅ Event consumers for processing events from Kafka topics
- ✅ Setup scripts for building backend and running Kafka locally
- ✅ Updated README with architecture overview and setup instructions

### In Progress

- Secure user authentication with multi-factor authentication
- Implementation of API endpoints for real-time sales transactions
- Implementation of inventory management endpoints
- Implementation of endpoints for offline data synchronization
- Integration with payment gateways

### Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of controllers for each endpoint
2. Implement service layer logic for business operations
3. Add multi-factor authentication support
4. Set up payment gateway integrations
5. Add comprehensive error handling middleware
6. Write unit and integration tests for all components

## Dependencies

The backend depends on the following technologies:

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.4.3
- PostgreSQL
- Apache Kafka
- Spring Security
- Lombok

## Running the Backend

To run the backend locally:

1. Start PostgreSQL server
2. Start Kafka using the provided script: `./scripts/run-kafka.sh`
3. Build the application: `./scripts/build.sh`
4. Run the application: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

The backend will be available at http://localhost:8080.
Swagger UI documentation is available at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.
