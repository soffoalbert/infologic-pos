4.  Install Java Development Kit (JDK 17) required for Spring Boot. (Backend Structure Document: Environment)
5.  **Validation**: Run `java -version` to confirm JDK installation. (Backend Structure Document: Environment)
6.  Create a new project directory structure. For example, create directories `/frontend` and `/backend` in your repo. (Project Requirements Document: Structure)
7.  Install and configure Docker on your machine to containerize applications. (Tech Stack Document: Containerization)
8.  **Validation**: Run `docker --version` to ensure Docker is correctly installed. (Tech Stack Document: Containerization)
9.  Install and set up a local Kubernetes cluster (using Minikube or similar) for container orchestration testing. (Tech Stack Document: Orchestration)
10. **Validation**: Run `kubectl version` and verify cluster status. (Tech Stack Document: Orchestration)
11. Install and configure Apache Kafka locally for event-driven messaging. (Tech Stack Document: Messaging)
12. **Validation**: Run a test Kafka producer/consumer to confirm that messaging works correctly. (Tech Stack Document: Messaging)
13. Set up a GitHub repository and configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines. (Tech Stack Document: CI/CD)
14. **Validation**: Confirm repository initialization and that GitHub Actions triggers on commits. (Cursor Project Rules)

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Initialize a new Expo project inside the `/frontend` directory using `expo init MobilePOS`. (Frontend Guidelines Document: Project Setup)
2.  Create the main `App.js` file in `/frontend` to serve as the starting point of your React Native app. (Frontend Guidelines Document: Project Structure)
3.  Set up React Navigation within the Expo project for multi-screen routing. (App Flow Document: Navigation)
4.  **Validation**: Run `expo start` and verify navigation between placeholder screens.
5.  Develop the authentication UI screens (e.g., Login, Registration) with input fields and multi-factor prompts. (Project Requirements Document: User Authentication & Multi-Tenancy)
6.  **Validation**: Test UI inputs and navigation between Login and Registration screens on Expo simulator.
7.  Create UI components for the POS functionalities (e.g., Sales Screen, Inventory Management, Reporting Dashboard). Place these components under `/frontend/src/components`. (Project Requirements Document: Core Features)
8.  Integrate a touch-friendly design using vibrant and earthy tones with sans-serif fonts (Roboto or Open Sans) as per design guidelines. (Frontend Guidelines Document: Design Style)
9.  **Validation**: Manually verify UI components on various device simulators/emulators.
10. Implement multi-language support using a library like i18next. Create language files such as `/frontend/assets/locales/en.json` and `/frontend/assets/locales/za.json`. (Project Requirements Document: Localization)
11. **Validation**: Toggle languages in the app and ensure translations display correctly.
12. Add error handling logic in the UI to display clear and simple error messages. (Project Requirements Document: Error Handling)
13. Integrate offline data handling using AsyncStorage for local persistence. (Project Requirements Document: Offline Functionality)
14. **Validation**: Simulate offline mode and verify data persistence and later synchronization.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Initialize a new Spring Boot project within the `/backend` directory. Use the Spring Initializr to generate a base project with dependencies such as Spring Web, Spring Security, JPA, and PostgreSQL. (Backend Structure Document: Project Setup)
2.  Set up the PostgreSQL connection in `application.properties` with tenant-specific schema isolation. (Project Requirements Document: Multi-Tenancy)
3.  **Validation**: Confirm connectivity to PostgreSQL using a simple JPA repository test.
4.  Implement secure user authentication including multi-factor authentication and role-based access control (Admin, Vendor, Cashier) by creating authentication controllers and services in `/backend/src/main/java/com/project/auth/`. (Project Requirements Document: User Authentication & Multi-Tenancy)
5.  **Validation**: Write and run JUnit tests for authentication endpoints.
6.  Develop API endpoints for real-time sales transactions (e.g., `POST /api/sales`) in `/backend/src/main/java/com/project/sales/`. (Project Requirements Document: Real-time Sales Transactions)
7.  Create inventory management endpoints (e.g., GET inventory, update inventory) in `/backend/src/main/java/com/project/inventory/`. (Project Requirements Document: Inventory Management)
8.  **Validation**: Test these endpoints using Postman to ensure correct functionality.
9.  Implement endpoints to handle offline data synchronization with conflict resolution logic (last-write-wins with alerts) in `/backend/src/main/java/com/project/sync/`. (Project Requirements Document: Offline Functionality)
10. Set up integration with Apache Kafka by adding producers and consumers in the backend for event-driven processing. (Tech Stack Document: Messaging)
11. **Validation**: Produce and consume test messages to verify Kafka integration.
12. Integrate payment gateway endpoints for Flutterwave, Stripe, and M-Pesa in `/backend/src/main/java/com/project/payments/`. (Project Requirements Document: Payment Gateway Integrations)
13. **Validation**: Write unit tests for payment processing endpoints and simulate payment transactions.
14. Add global error handling and secure configuration (data encryption at rest and in transit, CORS settings) in Spring Boot. (Project Requirements Document: Security)
15. **Validation**: Use integration tests to check error responses and secure headers on API calls.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  Integrate frontend API calls by creating service modules (e.g., `/frontend/src/services/api.js`) that use `fetch` or Axios to call backend endpoints. (App Flow Document: API Integration)
2.  Connect the authentication, sales, inventory, and synchronization endpoints with corresponding UI actions in the Expo app. (App Flow Document: User Workflows)
3.  Configure real-time communication between the frontend and backend by leveraging Kafka events where necessary. (Tech Stack Document: Messaging)
4.  **Validation**: Test end-to-end functionality using Postman and in-app testing to ensure the frontend communicates accurately with backend services.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Create a Dockerfile for the Spring Boot backend in `/backend/Dockerfile` to containerize the application. (Tech Stack Document: Containerization)
2.  Build Kubernetes deployment manifests in `/k8s` for backend, PostgreSQL, and Apache Kafka, then deploy them to AWS EKS in the `us-east-1` region. (Tech Stack Document: Orchestration & Deployment)
3.  Configure CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to automate build, test, and deployment processes. **Validation**: Execute a full pipeline run ensuring all stages (build, test, deploy) pass successfully. (Tech Stack Document: CI/CD)
