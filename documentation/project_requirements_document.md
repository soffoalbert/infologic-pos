# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

We are building a multi-tenant, event-driven mobile point of sale (POS) system for small-scale informal traders in Africa, starting with South Africa. This open-source initiative is designed to serve vendors in markets and on the streets by providing a simple, affordable, and efficient way to track sales and manage inventory. The system is tailor-made for traders with limited technical expertise, featuring a touch-friendly interface and offline functionality that synchronizes data once connectivity is restored.

The project is being built to solve everyday challenges that many informal vendors face, such as tracking transactions efficiently, managing stock levels automatically, and processing multiple payment methods with minimal fuss. Key objectives include ensuring data security (with multi-factor authentication and encryption), ease of use through an intuitive user interface, robust performance with an event-driven design using Apache Kafka, and seamless scalability through technologies like Kubernetes and AWS. Success will be measured by the system’s ability to handle real-time transactions accurately, support multiple tenants with isolated data, and deliver a smooth user experience even in offline modes.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Multi-tenant support with tenant-specific schema isolation in PostgreSQL.
*   Secure user authentication with options for multi-factor authentication.
*   Real-time sales transaction recording and reporting using an event-driven architecture (leveraging Apache Kafka).
*   Intuitive and touch-friendly mobile interface built with React Native and Expo.
*   Inventory management capabilities that include automatic updates and alert notifications (low stock, out-of-stock, restock reminders, and inventory discrepancy alerts).
*   Offline functionality that queues sales, inventory updates, and other operations with a synchronization mechanism upon reconnection (with conflict resolution strategies).
*   Support for multiple payment methods (cash, mobile money, card payments) and integration with payment gateways such as Flutterwave or Stripe.
*   Reporting and analytics module for sales trends, inventory usage, and transaction summaries.
*   Account settings, language selection, and customizable notification preferences with support for multiple languages and localization.
*   Cloud infrastructure on AWS with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).
*   Automated CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Advanced integrations with external physical hardware (e.g., dedicated POS hardware beyond mobile devices).
*   Custom branding guidelines or extensive theme customization beyond a simple, modern clean design with vibrant and earthy tones.
*   Integration with extensive ERP or accounting systems outside the basic inventory and transaction tracking.
*   Additional feature modules that cater to large-scale enterprises; this version focuses solely on small-scale informal traders.
*   Building separate databases for each tenant; only a shared PostgreSQL database with tenant-specific schemas will be used.

## 3. User Flow

A new user opens the app and is greeted by an onboarding screen that guides them through a brief tutorial, language selection, and an explanation of the core features. The user then signs up via secure authentication, which includes multi-factor authentication for added security. Once logged in, the user selects a role (admin, vendor, or cashier). Depending on this role, the app tailors the home screen, displaying dashboards with real-time sales data, inventory alerts, and a snapshot of key metrics. Navigation is straightforward with clear icons and a simple layout tailored for ease of use.

The user can then dive into the various functionalities: accessing the sales interface to process transactions using a variety of payment methods, managing inventory through a dedicated module that sends real-time notifications for low or out-of-stock items, and generating reports that visually present sales and inventory trends. In case the internet connection is lost, the app allows full offline functionality by queuing sales and updates. Once connectivity is restored, the system synchronizes all data using smart conflict resolution strategies (last-write-wins by default, with alerts for manual review when needed). Finally, the settings area allows the user to update their profile, manage preferences, and configure alerts.

*   **Compliance:**

    *   Adherence to relevant data protection and privacy standards to ensure the security and integrity of sensitive user data.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The system assumes that informal traders have basic smartphone skills but limited familiarity with advanced technology.
*   Multi-tenant data isolation will be maintained through PostgreSQL’s schema-based approach rather than separate databases for each tenant.
*   The system will only support offline data synchronization with a last-write-wins policy by default, with manual conflict resolution for critical data.
*   Security enhancements include multi-factor authentication and TLS/SSL, with ongoing security audits assumed to be part of maintenance.
*   Integration with external payment systems (e.g., Flutterwave, M-Pesa) is dependent on the availability and API support from those providers.
*   The project is designed with an event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka to handle asynchronous operations reliably.
*   It is assumed that the initial user base will be small-scale informal traders, so feature complexity and scalability requirements are tailored for this group.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits:**

    *   External services like payment gateways may enforce rate limits; caching and error handling strategies need to be devised to manage this.

*   **Data Synchronization Conflicts:**

    *   Offline data synchronization might result in duplicate or conflicting entries. The current strategy is to apply a last-write-wins policy, but there is a risk of data integrity issues that may require user intervention for manual reviews.

*   **Network Reliability:**

    *   Intermittent connectivity can lead to challenges in ensuring all transactions are captured and synchronized accurately. An effective offline queuing system is essential to mitigate data loss.

*   **Scalability Challenges:**

    *   As the number of tenants increases, the shared PostgreSQL database with schema-based isolation might require optimization for performance. Monitoring tools and regular database tuning will be necessary.

*   **User Adoption & Training:**

    *   Given the limited technical expertise of many target users, comprehensive onboarding and support documentation will be crucial to ensure ease of use.

*   **Security Threats:**

    *   Multi-tenant systems are inherently more complex to secure. Continuous security monitoring, regular patching, and vulnerability assessments are needed to prevent data breaches.

By keeping these potential issues in mind and planning mitigation strategies, the development process will be more resilient, ensuring that the POS system meets the needs of its target audience while maintaining high standards of performance and security.

This document should provide all the necessary details for subsequent technical documents as we move forward with development.
