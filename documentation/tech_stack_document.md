# Tech Stack Document

This document explains, in easy-to-understand language, the technology choices behind our multi-tenant, event-driven mobile POS system designed for informal traders in Africa. Each section outlines what we are using and why these choices help us build a fast, secure, and user-friendly application.

## Frontend Technologies

Our mobile app is built using modern tools that ensure it can run smoothly on multiple devices while offering a great user experience:

*   **React Native**: This framework allows us to build native-like mobile apps using JavaScript, which makes our app feel fast and responsive.
*   **Expo**: A tool that works with React Native to simplify development and testing. It helps us make sure the app works seamlessly across different mobile platforms without complex setups.

*Why this matters:*

These technologies create an interface that’s easy to use, especially for traders who may have basic smartphone skills. The clean, touch-friendly design ensures that interacting with features like sales tracking or inventory updates is simple and efficient.

## Backend Technologies

Behind the scenes, our application uses a robust backend system that manages data, processes transactions, and ensures everything works in real time:

*   **Java with Spring Boot**: Java is a reliable programming language, and Spring Boot makes it easier to build scalable and secure server applications to manage sales data, user accounts, and more.
*   **PostgreSQL**: An open-source SQL database that stores data like sales, inventory, and user details. Using PostgreSQL with schema-based multi-tenancy ensures that each business (tenant) has its data securely and efficiently organized.
*   **Apache Kafka**: This messaging system allows our app to be event-driven. In simple terms, it helps the system instantly process every sale or inventory update in real time, making updates fast and reliable.

*How they work together:*

When a sale is completed or inventory is updated, Java and Spring Boot process the information, PostgreSQL securely stores it, and Apache Kafka ensures that all these events are handled in real time. This means traders can see updates immediately, even if they are working offline which is crucial for areas with intermittent internet access.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

For our app to be reliable and easy to update, we have chosen modern deployment and management tools:

*   **Docker**: This technology packages our app in a way that ensures it will work exactly the same in all environments, from a developer’s laptop to a live server.
*   **Kubernetes**: A system for managing Docker containers. It helps us scale the app easily (growing the system as more traders join) and makes sure our containers are running smoothly across multiple machines.
*   **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Our cloud provider, offering scalable and reliable computing resources. AWS ensures that our app can handle many users and transactions without downtime.
*   **GitHub Actions**: Used for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). This tool automates testing and deployment, reducing errors and ensuring that updates are rolled out quickly and safely.

*The benefits:*

The combination of these tools makes our app reliable, scalable, and quicker to update. It also means that even if there’s a temporary hiccup in the internet connection, traders can continue working, and everything will sync automatically once back online.

## Third-Party Integrations

In addition to our own technologies, our app leverages several external services to enhance functionality:

*   **Payment Gateways (e.g., Flutterwave, Stripe, or mobile money solutions)**: These services allow the app to support a variety of payment methods including cash, mobile money, and card payments. They simplify the sales process and offer secure transaction processing.
*   **Additional Integrations**: We plan to integrate with local mobile payment platforms such as M-Pesa and support inventory supplier systems for automatic restock orders.

*Why they are important:*

Integrating these services means traders can accept various forms of payment, making the system flexible and accessible. It also streamlines operations like restocking, giving vendors peace of mind.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Ensuring the app is both secure and performs well under different conditions has guided many of our technology choices:

*   **Security Measures**:

    *   Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of safety during user login.
    *   Data encryption both at rest (when stored in PostgreSQL) and in transit (using protocols like TLS/SSL) to protect sensitive information.
    *   Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to ensure everything stays secure over time.

*   **Performance Optimizations**:

    *   The event-driven design with Apache Kafka ensures that transactions are handled in real time.
    *   Containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes allow our system to handle increasing numbers of users seamlessly.
    *   Offline functionality ensures that even without internet connectivity, critical operations like sales recording are performed, with data synchronized later.

*Overall benefits:*

These steps ensure that the system is resilient, fast, and secure—providing a reliable tool for traders who need a robust yet easy-to-use solution for managing their sales and inventory.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

Our chosen tech stack has been carefully selected to meet both the technical requirements and the everyday needs of our users. Here’s a quick recap:

*   **Frontend**: React Native with Expo enhances usability and supports quick, cross-platform mobile development.
*   **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Apache Kafka work together to process transactions, store data securely, and ensure real-time updates.
*   **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and GitHub Actions ensure our app is scalable, consistently deployed, and reliably maintained.
*   **Third-Party Integrations**: Payment gateways and local mobile payment solutions expand our app's functionality without complicating the user experience.
*   **Security and Performance**: Multi-factor authentication, encryption strategies, event-driven design, and offline support guarantee a secure, fast, and user-friendly experience.

These choices not only align with our project’s goals of affordability, scalability, and simplicity but also ensure that the system remains robust and secure. The technology stack provides a solid foundation for building a solution that truly makes a difference for informal traders, allowing them to manage sales, inventory, and transactions with ease and confidence.

By using these technologies, our project is set apart through its focus on real-time processing, multi-tenancy, and an intuitive, user-centric design approach.
