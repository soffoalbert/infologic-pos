# App Flow Document for Mobile POS System

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user launches the app for the very first time, they are welcomed by a clean, simple onboarding screen designed to guide them through the basic features and functionality of the application. Upon launch, users are presented with language options and a brief, interactive tutorial that highlights key features such as sales tracking, inventory management, and reporting. The app then directs users to the sign-up process which is designed to be as straightforward as possible. New users can create an account using their email address or opt for available social login methods if integrated. In addition to collecting essential information, the sign-up process allows users to select their role – whether they are an admin, vendor, or cashier – which tailors their subsequent experience in the app. For returning users, a simple and secure sign-in page is provided. This page includes options for multi-factor authentication to enhance security and features a clear path for password recovery should they need assistance. Once their credentials are verified, users are seamlessly directed to the main dashboard.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful sign-in, the user is immediately greeted by the home screen, which functions as the main dashboard of the application. This screen is designed with intuitive, user-friendly navigation in mind and presents a snapshot of daily sales performance along with key financial and inventory metrics. The layout is clean and modern, enhanced by vibrant yet earthy tones that resonate with local cultural aesthetics. At the top of the screen, users can view quick stats about transactions and critical alerts, including low stock warnings and discrepancies in inventory levels. Multiple navigation elements such as a header, sidebar, and visible icons allow for easy access to various core functionalities like processing sales, checking transaction history, managing inventory, generating reports, and adjusting settings. The design ensures that users with limited technical expertise can effortlessly transition between different sections of the app without encountering confusion.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The core functionality of the app begins with the sales processing flow. From the main dashboard, users can navigate to the sales interface, where each transaction is captured in real time. This page is optimized for minimal input with a touch-friendly layout that supports various payment methods, including cash, mobile money, and card payments via integrated gateways. As transactions are completed, digital receipts are generated automatically and stored for future reference. This interface seamlessly transitions to display a detailed transaction history that users can review at any time. In parallel, the inventory management module is easily accessible from the dashboard. On this page, users can view current stock levels, add new inventory items, and receive prompt alerts when stock levels fall below predetermined thresholds. The system also flags any inconsistencies between recorded sales and current inventory, advising users to undertake manual verification if necessary. For those interested in analytical insights, the reporting section provides interactive charts and summaries of sales trends and inventory usage over various time periods. Navigation between these pages is designed to be smooth and logical, where completing a sale, checking inventory, or viewing reports does not disrupt the overall workflow; each action naturally leads to options for further exploration or returning to the home screen.

## Settings and Account Management

Users have complete control over their personal information and application preferences through the settings and account management panel. Whether updating profile information, changing password details, or modifying alert preferences, the user interface is designed to be straightforward and intuitive. This section also lets users manage tenant-specific settings, ensuring that each business instance maintains its own isolated configuration in a multi-tenant system using PostgreSQL schema-based isolation. The panel provides straightforward navigation for updating multi-factor authentication settings, adjusting notification types such as low-stock alerts or transaction warnings, and even customizing language or interface themes to better suit user needs. Any changes made in the settings area are immediately applied across the app and users can effortlessly return to their workflows once their configurations are updated.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application is engineered to gracefully handle error states and alternate navigation paths, ensuring an uninterrupted user experience. If a user enters invalid data during sign-up, transaction processing, or inventory updates, clear error messages appear that explain the issue in simple language and guide the user toward a corrective action. In situations where connectivity is lost, the app is built to operate fully in an offline mode without impeding core functionalities. Users can continue processing sales, updating inventory, or navigating through non-real-time data screens while offline. When the connection is re-established, the app automatically synchronizes data with the backend system using an event-driven approach with Apache Kafka, ensuring that any duplicate or conflicting information is handled through a last-write-wins policy supplemented by relevant user alerts for critical data. If a user attempts to access restricted areas or perform actions beyond their role, the app intercepts these requests and provides feedback while redirecting them to the allowed functionalities based on their permission level.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The journey through the mobile POS system is designed to be both robust and streamlined, accommodating the needs of small-scale informal traders in South Africa and beyond. Starting with a simplified onboarding and secure sign-in process that caters to varying levels of technical expertise, users quickly progress to a comprehensive yet intuitive dashboard that lays out all essential metrics. From there, every aspect of the application – from processing transactions in a sales interface that supports various payment methods to managing inventory with smart alerts and generating insightful reports – is interconnected, ensuring a cohesive and uninterrupted workflow. The integrated settings panel provides continued customization and precise control over user data and preferences, while proactive error handling and offline support maintain system reliability under all circumstances. Overall, the app flows naturally from sign-up through everyday sales and inventory management activities, culminating in a system that is secure, accessible, and ideally suited to the unique requirements of informal traders.
