# Backend Structure Document

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the backend architecture, hosting solutions, and infrastructure components for our multi-tenant, event-driven mobile POS system. It explains the design in everyday language and outlines how each component works together to meet the project’s goals.

## 1. Backend Architecture

Our backend is built using a robust Java and Spring Boot framework with an event-driven design. This approach allows for a responsive system that can handle real-time sales transactions and inventory updates. Below are some key design patterns and considerations:

*   **Design Patterns & Frameworks:**

    *   Java with Spring Boot provides a modular and scalable approach.
    *   Event-driven architecture leverages Apache Kafka for processing real-time events, such as sales recording, inventory changes, and payment transactions.

*   **Scalability, Maintainability, and Performance:**

    *   Designed to scale horizontally using Kubernetes, ensuring that as demand increases, new instances of our services can be spun up on AWS.
    *   Code is organized in modules and microservices to keep maintenance simple.
    *   The event-driven architecture ensures that updates and transactions are processed concurrently, which minimizes delays and improves performance.

## 2. Database Management

We use PostgreSQL as our main database to store and manage all application data, including user details, transactions, inventory records, and more. Here’s how the database is managed:

*   **Database Technology:**

    *   **Type:** Relational Database (SQL)
    *   **System:** PostgreSQL

*   **Data Structure and Storage:**

    *   All application data is stored in a single shared PostgreSQL database.
    *   Multi-tenancy is achieved through schema-based isolation, meaning each tenant (or client) gets its own schema, ensuring data privacy and security.
    *   Data is encrypted at rest using PostgreSQL’s encryption capabilities and in transit via TLS/SSL.

*   **Data Management Practices:**

    *   Regular backups and automated recovery processes are in place.
    *   Data integrity is maintained through transactions and rollback mechanisms in PostgreSQL.

## 3. Database Schema

This section provides a human-readable description of our database schema along with SQL statements designed for PostgreSQL:

### Human Readable Format

*   **Users Table:** Contains general user data such as username, password (encrypted), role (Admin, Vendor, Cashier), and multi-factor authentication details.
*   **Tenants Schemas:** Each tenant has its own schema for isolating transactions, inventory, and sales data.
*   **Sales and Transactions Table:** Records each sale with details like transaction time, amount, payment type (cash, mobile money, card), and digital receipt references.
*   **Inventory Table:** Tracks product details, stock levels, low-stock alerts, and inventory discrepancies.
*   **Audit Logs Table:** Stores logs for system events and errors for security and debugging purposes.

### SQL Schema for PostgreSQL

Below is a sample SQL schema for the shared components. Each tenant would have similar tables within their dedicated schema.

-- Example for a Global Users Table

-- Create a global users table CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.users ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE, password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- Admin, Vendor, Cashier mfa_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Example for a Tenant Schema (e.g., tenant_1) CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS tenant_1;

-- Within the tenant schema, a sales table could be structured as: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tenant_1.sales ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, transaction_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, amount NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL, payment_method VARCHAR(50), -- Examples: cash, mobile money, card receipt_reference VARCHAR(100), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Within the tenant schema, an inventory table could be structured as: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tenant_1.inventory ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, stock_level INTEGER DEFAULT 0, alert_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 5, last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Additional tables (like audit logs and transaction history) follow a similar structure.

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

Our API is designed using RESTful principles to ensure clear and efficient communication between the frontend and backend components. Here are the main aspects of our API design:

*   **Approach:** RESTful API

*   **Key Endpoints Include:**

    *   **Authentication Endpoints:**

        *   Signup, Login, and MFA verification
        *   Role-based access control to restrict API access based on user roles

    *   **Sales Endpoints:**

        *   Recording real-time sales transactions via POST requests
        *   Fetching transaction history through GET requests

    *   **Inventory Endpoints:**

        *   Updating and querying inventory information
        *   Alerts for low-stock or out-of-stock situations

    *   **Reporting Endpoints:**

        *   Dashboard data providing sales trends and analytics
        *   Detailed report exports

Each endpoint handles clear error messages and includes necessary validations to support seamless user experience, especially in offline scenarios with later data synchronization.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

Our backend is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to take advantage of its scalability and reliability. Here are the key aspects of our hosting solution:

*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS

*   **Benefits:**

    *   **Reliability:** AWS provides high uptime and managed services that reduce operational overhead.
    *   **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling is achieved using Kubernetes clusters, allowing the system to handle increased loads seamlessly.
    *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** AWS offers flexible pricing and resource optimization, ensuring that costs are controlled as the platform scales.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

Our backend environment includes several important infrastructure components working together to provide a robust, performant experience:

*   **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming API requests to multiple instances, ensuring balanced resource usage.

*   **Caching Mechanisms:** In-memory caches (like Redis or similar) are used to speed up frequent queries and reduce database load.

*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Used for serving static resources quickly, enhancing the user interface's responsiveness.

*   **Messaging System:** Apache Kafka manages event-driven communication across the system, dealing with real-time sales and sensor updates.

*   **Containerization and Orchestration:**

    *   Docker containers package the backend services, ensuring environment consistency.
    *   Kubernetes orchestrates these containers, managing scaling and deployment.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is a top priority. The following practices ensure the backend is secure and user data is protected:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**

    *   Secure signup/login with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Role-based access control ensures users see only what they’re permitted to access (Admin, Vendor, Cashier).

*   **Data Encryption:**

    *   Data at rest is encrypted (PostgreSQL encryption).
    *   Data in transit is secured using TLS/SSL.

*   **Regular Security Audits:** Scheduled scans and audits ensure vulnerabilities are detected and addressed promptly.

*   **Tenant Isolation:** Multi-tenancy is implemented using separate PostgreSQL schemas, keeping each tenant’s data isolated.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Maintaining a healthy backend system is vital for performance and reliability. Here’s how we monitor and maintain the system:

*   **Monitoring Tools:**

    *   AWS CloudWatch for tracking system metrics and performance.
    *   Logging systems integrated with our application to gather real-time logs and alerts.
    *   Kafka monitoring tools to ensure event processing is running smoothly.

*   **Maintenance Practices:**

    *   Automated backups and regular database health checks.
    *   Routine updates and security patching, according to our CI/CD pipelines powered by GitHub Actions.
    *   Incident response strategies to quickly address any outages or performance issues.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary
